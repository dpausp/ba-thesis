Process modeling is a widespread technique which is used for planning, analysis and optimization of business processes. 
Software tools for this purpose mostly use 2D notations for the display of process diagrams.

3D process visualizations haven't been studied extensively. 
Especially, usable interactive systems for business process modeling are missing.

The project called i>PM3D aims at developing a flexible 3D modeling tool for perspective oriented process modeling. 
Our tool also supports innovative 3D input devices like Microsoft Kinect or Nintendo Wii and makes it easy to add other input techniques. 

This thesis is concerned with the conception and realization of process visualization in i>PM3D. 
Additionally, it is shown how models are represented internally in our tool. 
Models can be saved to and loaded from a textual notation stored on disk. 
The language used for these models is described by modifiable meta models so it can be adapted to special use cases.
This work also includes a render library based on OpenGL, which was developed for the needs of i>PM3D but can also be used for other graphical applications.
